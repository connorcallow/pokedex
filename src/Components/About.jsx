        <h2>The Pokédex (ポケモン図鑑, Pokémon Zukan, lit.: Pokémon Encyclopedia) is an electronic device designed to 
            catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon.
             The name Pokédex is a portmanteau of Pokémon and index.
              In the video games, whenever a Pokémon is first caught, its height, weight, 
              species type, and a short description will be added to a player's Pokédex. Each 
              region has its own Pokédex, which differs in appearance, species of Pokémon catalogued, 
              and functions. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which takes place long before any other Pokémon 
              games, players are tasked with assembling the first-ever Pokédex
